         <p> Hi! Welcome! I'm Anthony Irizarry and this is my first project from my Web Development class. </p>
         <h4> About me </h4>
         <p>I am a second year student ITM student at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I look forward to specializing in either Cybersecurity or Digital Systems Technology and Embedded Systems </p>
         <p>I'm a commuter student originally from Chicago, so I have a pretty extensive knowledge of my city. I also went to high school in Chicago at Lane Tech College Prep. </p>
         <p>My favorite pasttime is actually just driving around the Chicagoland area in search of beautiful views of the sunset. It combines what I love which is cars and music :) </p>

            <ul class= "facts">
               <li> I bought a Corvette when I was 17, sadly 80's corvettes tend to have a lot of problems which led me to sell it</li>
               <li>I built two of my gaming PC's, my most recent one has an RTX 2070, I7-8700K and 32GiB of RAM </li>
